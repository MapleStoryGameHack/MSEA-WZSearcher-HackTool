MSEA-WZSearcher-HackTool
========================

One of my tool made back in 2012 while I'm still on the MapleStory hacking/server scene. 
I think it s time this gets released to the public for anyone to use and to innovate on top of it.

Features:
-Reads and parse String.wz data for Maps/Inventories/
-Get any mapid via string searching quickly [Handy if you have a map teleport, one I used to have]
-Get any eq/use/setup/etc/cash ItemId via string searching
-DLL injector that works for HackShield
-Integer to Hex calculator (into MapleStory's Little Endian byte string)
-Packet builder... (int64, int32, int16, int8, string -> MapleStory's packet byte)
-MapleSEA/EMS packet encryptor (RSA2048)

So what are you waiting for? Download and build on top of it now!
